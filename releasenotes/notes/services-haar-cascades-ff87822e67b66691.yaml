    Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an
    effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael
    Jones in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade
    of Simple Features" in 2001. It is a machine learning based approach
    where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and
    and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.
